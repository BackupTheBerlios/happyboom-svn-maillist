 Explore a field set using it's path
 -----------------------------------
 
 Fields are stored in a tree. To explore the tree you have differents tools:
- * attribute root of a field which go to tree root ;
- * attribute parent go to field parent (is None for tree root) ;
- * and you can specify a path in __getitem__() argument.
+ * attribute *root* of a field which go to tree root ;

 There are differents valid syntax of a path:
- * path to a child of current node: field[&quot;content&quot;] ;
- * path to a child of the parent: field[&quot;../brother&quot;] ;
- * path from the root: field[&quot;/header/key&quot;].
+ * path to a child of current node: ``field[&quot;content&quot;]`` ;

+ * path from the root: ``field[&quot;/header/key&quot;]``.
 
 Event handling
 --------------
 
 Code is not finished yet, so don't need documentation :-) See:
- * FieldSet.connect(event, handler)
- * FieldSet.raiseEvent(event,  arg1, arg2, ...)
+ * ``FieldSet.connect(event, handler)`` ;
+ * ``FieldSet.raiseEvent(event,  arg1, arg2, ...)``.
